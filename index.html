                    <p>
                        Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 
                        18 years old that are diagnosed with a disability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie 
                        Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of individuals 
                        disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of donations being 
                        used to cover overheads instead of going to the ones who need it most, 
                        the Kids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for 
                        the children, with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute 
                        minimum and looked after by the Directors and friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided over 
                        150 grants covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing 
                        and other assistance to these very special kids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity 
                        of Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts and through 
                        various yearly fund raising activities.These includes the Mercedes 
                        Benz Polo Championships held each September and a Brisbane Businessmanâ€™s 
                        lunch held each November.
